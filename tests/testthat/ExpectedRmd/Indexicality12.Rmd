Question
========
Identify all the indexical expressions in the passage below, and state how each one is interpreted according to the utterance context.

When I saw John the other day he had just come out of the tube station. He was standing right here in front of the doorway - I nearly ran into him. He said 'Oh, it's you' in the most peculiar way - I thought he was annoyed that I knew he had been in there.


Solution
========
**I** : refers to the speaker

**past tense of saw**: the seeing happened at a time before the time of utterance

**the other day**: the seeing happened a day or two before the day of utterance

**past perfect tense of had come out**: the seeing happened before the time of

utterance, and the coming out happened before the seeing.

**past tense of was**: John's standing in front of the doorway happened before the time

of utterance.

**here**: At the indicated location.

**I** : refers to the speaker

**I** : refers to the speaker

**past tense of ran**: the running happened at a time before the time of utterance

**past tense of said**: the speaking happened at a time before the time of utterance. 

**I**: refers to the speaker. 

**past tense of thought**: the thinking happened at a time before the time of utterance

**past tense of was**: the being annoyed happened at a time before the time of

utterance

**past tense of knew**: the knowing happened at a time before the time of utterance. 

**past perfect tense of had been**: the knowing happened at a time before the time of utterance, and the being in there happened before the knowing.

**there**: This is more likely to be an anaphor, with antecedent the tube station. It could

be indexical if the speaker points to indicate the intended location.
