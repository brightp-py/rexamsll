Question
========
Identify the anaphoric expressions and their antecedents in the passage below. 

Clive and Marcia had themselves photographed first thing on Tuesday, and in the afternoon of the same day their secretary drew up a list of things to do. Ordering the passports, arranging visas, buying travellers' cheques and other such matters were Marcia's province, while Clive shopped busily for suntan lotion, enjoyable trashy paperbacks and those stick-on patches for seasickness. Clive bought mostly spy thrillers to read, which annoyed Marcia as she preferred murder mysteries. When Marcia was organizing the visas she found she couldn't get herself one for Burma, although Clive still wanted to go there. Nevertheless, none of this depressed their holiday mood; Marcia became more and more excited and so did Clive.
