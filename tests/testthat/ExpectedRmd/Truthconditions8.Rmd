Question
========
`r if (instructions) "Recall that possible worlds theory analyzes the meaning of a sentence as its truth set, or the set of all possible worlds in which the sentence is true. This doesn't always work out. Can you identify the problem for the groups of sentences below? (Hint: What is the truth set for each sentence?)" else ""`

`r qrow$question`


Solution
========
`r qrow$explanation`
