# number of different answers the student can choose from.
# one is the correct answer.
nchoices <- 4

## this variable should be changed externally using expar.
qvariation <- 1

## build a dataframe and add all the variations of this question.
df <- add_question(
    question = "Question text 1.",
    image = "Image 1.png", # optional
    explanation = "Explanation 1.", # optional
    correct = "Answer 1.",
    incorrect = c("Answer 2.", "Answer 3.", "Answer 4.", "Answer 5."),

    df = df
)

## if any components need to be the same throughout all questions, the column
## can be changed here. e.g. to have all questions use "Default Image.png":
## df$image <- "Default Image.png"

## find the row corresponding to the chosen question variation.
if (qvariation > nrow(df)) {
    stop(sprintf(
        "Question variation %d is greater than the number of options (%d).",
        qvariation, nrow(df)))
}
qrow <- df[qvariation, ]

## include the image as a supplemental file.
include_supplement(qrow$image, dir = "./img", recursive = TRUE)

## sample correct and incorrect answers from qrow.
correct <- sample(qrow$correct[[1]], size = 1)
incorrect <- sample(qrow$incorrect[[1]], size = nchoices - 1)

## concatenate the two to get a list of all the answers.
choices <- c(correct, incorrect)
