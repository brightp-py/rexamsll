```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}

## if you don't have an image, delete this code block.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
# all possible answers
correct <- c("Answer 1.", "Answer 2.", "Answer 3.")
incorrect <- c("Answer 4.", "Answer 5.", "Answer 6.")

# number of different answers the student can choose from.
# one is the correct answer.
nchoices <- 4

# number of correct answers.
# a random number between min_correct and max_correct will be chosen.
# to have the highest possible maximum, use:
#   max_correct <- min(c(length(correct), nchoices))
# to have a fixed number of correct answers, use:
#   max_correct <- min_correct
min_correct <- 2
max_correct <- 3
ncorrect <- sample(min_correct:max_correct, 1)

## sample correct and incorrect answers from qrow.
correct <- sample(correct, size = ncorrect)
incorrect <- sample(incorrect, size = nchoices - ncorrect)

## concatenate the two to get a list of all the answers.
choices <- c(correct, incorrect)

## generate the binary 'solution' string.
## this is a string of 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates the correct answer.
solution <- rep(0, nchoices)
solution[seq_len(ncorrect)] <- 1
solution <- paste0(solution, collapse = "")
