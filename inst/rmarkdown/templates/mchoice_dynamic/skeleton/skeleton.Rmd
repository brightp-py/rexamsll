## if any components need to be the same throughout all questions, the column
## can be changed here. e.g. to have all questions use "Default Image.png":
## df$image <- "Default Image.png"

## find the row corresponding to the chosen question variation.
if (qvariation > nrow(df)) {
    stop(sprintf(
        "Question variation %d is greater than the number of options (%d).",

}
qrow <- df[qvariation, ]

## if there aren't at least `ncorrect` correct answers, decrease ncorrect
ncorrect <- min(c(ncorrect, length(qrow$correct %>% unlist)))

## include the image as a supplemental file.
include_supplement(qrow$image, dir = "./img", recursive = TRUE)

## sample correct and incorrect answers from qrow.
correct <- sample(qrow$correct %>% unlist, size = ncorrect)
incorrect <- sample(qrow$incorrect %>% unlist, size = nchoices - ncorrect)

## concatenate the two to get a list of all the answers.
