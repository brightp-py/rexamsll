This document should be integrated into `pkgdown` once it is available.

# Install

While `rexamsll` is in development, the most recently pushed version can be
installed through GitHub using the devtools library.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("https://github.com/examLing/rexamsll")
library(rexamsll)
```

# Generate `.Rmd` Files from Google Sheets

## Build the Sheet

Create a new Google Sheets document, and fill row 1 with the following headers:

* `ID`
* `Question`
* `Type`
* `Image`
* `Ans1`, `Ans2`, `Ans3`...*
* `Correct`
* `Category`
* `SubCat`

\* You may use any number of `Ans` columns. Simply label them accordingly.

**Before adding any more text**, click the light gray box in the top right
corner to select the entire spreadsheet.

Then, set the entire Sheet to plain text. To do this, Press the button that
says "123" (to the left of the font-selection box) and choose "Plain Text".

Doing this ensures that any numbers you input will be saved exactly as you
write them.

To add a question, start by putting a unique identifier in the `ID` column. If
multiple rows have the same identifier, they will be associated with each
other (See [Generate Dynamic Questions](#generateDynamicQuestions)).

Then, write the main body text of the question in the `Question` column.
`rexamsll` uses [R-markdown](https://r02pro.github.io/rmd-text-formating.html)
to format text, so you can, for example, **bold** text by typing "\*\*" on each
side.

The `Type` column dictates what kind of answer is expected for this question.
There are three main choices:

1. **schoice** - There is a single correct answer, and all other options are
   wrong.
2. **mchoice** - There is any number of correct answers, and the student is
   graded on how many of these select without choosing incorrect answers.
3. **string** - There are no provided answers and the student is instead given
   an area to input text. The student's response must *exactly* match the
   correct answer to receive credit.

If the `Type` is **NOT** "string", provide all of the answers that the student
will need to choose from in the columns starting with `Ans`, including both
correct and incorrect options. You *do not* need to use all `Ans` columns.

The `Correct` column is used differently depending on the `Type`.

For **schoice** questions, the `Correct` value should be the *index*
corresponding to the correct answer. In the example provided, the correct
answer is "Giraffe", which is under the column `Ans3`. Therefore, the `Correct`
column should say "3".

For **mchoice** questions, the `Correct` value should be a comma-separated list
of all correct indices. For example, if the correct answers lie in the columns
`Ans1` and `Ans3`, this cell should say "1, 3".

For **string** questions, the `Correct` value should be the exact correct
answer. For example, if the question is "What color is chlorophyll?", this cell
should say "green".

The `Category` and `SubCat` columns are used for organization and naming files.
Their values should be short, informative names that will help you keep track
of topics. Questions with the same `Category` values should appear on the same
tests.

![](img/howto_googlesheets_05.png)

Now, add another row for every question you want to generate a `.Rmd` file for.

![](img/howto_googlesheets_07.png)

Give your Sheet a title and, optionally, click "View" -> "Freeze" -> "1 row" to
keep the header row visible while scrolling.
